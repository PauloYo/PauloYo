## Hi there!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Information Systems student at IFES on Espirito Santo, Brazil.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software engeneering and programming! Wich includes Back-End (such as Python, C, C#, Java, Node), Front-End (such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React) and Full-Stack (Typescript, Next.JS, ASP.NET).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **any** project that I would be helpfull in someway!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - Email: paulosousasancheslopes@gmail.com
- ðŸŽ­ My hobbies: gaming, music, geek, volleyball, rubik's cube, chess, drawings and hamburgers!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Well, besides what I've shown on my "learning tree", these were only my *main* abillities. I'm so curious about the technology field, so anything that appears on my sight I'm willing to learn and get better at it!
