## Yo!

- 🔭 I’m currently a Information Systems student at IFES on Espirito Santo, Brazil.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engeneering and programming! Wich includes Back-End (such as Python, C, C#, Java, Node), Front-End (such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React) and Full-Stack (Typescript, Next.JS, ASP.NET).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **any** project that I would be interested or helpfull in someway!
- 📫 How to reach me:

- 🎭 My hobbies: gaming, music, geek, volleyball, rubik's cube, chess, drawings and hamburgers!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Well, besides what I've shown on my "learning tree," these were only my main abilities. I'm very curious about the technology field, so anything that shows up on my radar, I'm willing to learn and improve at!
